Programs on Linked Lists

1- Python Linked Lists stores value at random locations but are linked to pointers to next element
2- Order is O(1) for inserting/deleting element at Start of LL
3- Order is O(n) for inserting/deleting element at end of LL
4- No pre-allocated space
5- LL travesal = O(n)
5- Accessing element by value = O(n)

Geometric progression based allocation of memory for Python Lists
